# CollegeAttendanceSystem
The College Attendance System (CAS) is a web-based software that aims to make the process of recording attendance easier and in digital form at educational institutions. Attendance systems manually are error-prone, time-consuming, and do not provide analytical data. CAS deals with all these disadvantages by offering an easy-to-use, simplified interface for adding students and subjects, recording attendance, and producing attendance data in real-time.

Developed on Flask (Python web framework) with SQLite as the database, this project illustrates how technology can assist in automating administrative processes in schools or colleges. The system has the potential to be easily expanded with functions such as report generation, defaulter reports, and visualizations.
